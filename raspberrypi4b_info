Useful commands
1. To view the Pi's temperature, type cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp. Divide the result by 1000 to find the value in degrees Celsius. 
   Alternatively, there is a vcgencmd, 'vcgencmd measure_temp' that interrogates the GPU directly for its temperature.
2. Measure ARM core clock frequency - 'vcgencmd measure_clock arm'
3. 'vcgencmd get_config int': this lists all the integer config options that are set (non-zero).
4. 'vcgencmd get_config str': this lists all the string config options that are set (non-null).
5. More documenation on config commands - https://elinux.org/RPiconfig
6. List of USB devices - lsusb
7. To add aliases - alias c='clear' to '~/.bashrc'
8. Cron jobs - https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/cron.md
9. Wireless network details - 'iwconfig'
10. See link quality continuously on screen - '/proc/net/wireless' OR 'cat /proc/net/wireless'
11. To continuesly run the above command - 'watch -n 1 cat /proc/net/wireless'
